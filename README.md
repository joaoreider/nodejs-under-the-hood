# Node.js Under the Hood

Welcome to the Node.js Core Concepts project! In this project I dedicated myself to understanding the main concepts of Nodejs and implement the fundamental building blocks of Node.js, including EventEmitters, File System operations, Streams, and Networking.

## Introduction

Node.js is a powerful runtime that allows you to build server-side applications using JavaScript. This project aims to deepen my understanding of core Node.js concepts through practical implementation.

## Project Overview

In this project, I focused on four main concepts:

1. **EventEmitters:** Create custom event emitters and subscribers to understand how events work in Node.js. Learn how to handle asynchronous events efficiently.

2. **File System (fs):** Hands-on experience with the File System module in Node.js. Cover reading, writing, and manipulating files asynchronously.

3. **Streams:** Explore readable and writable streams, which are essential for handling large amount of data efficiently. Learn how to create and use streams for various purposes.

4. **Network:** Delve into networking with Node.js. This will include building a simple server, making HTTP requests, and dealing with websockets.
